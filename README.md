# Quran-sur-renamer

The problem to fix: mostly when I am downloading the full Mushaf I find the file names in digits (001.mp3, 002.mp3) with some not oraganised metadata + if there was 2 or more recites from different
Sheikhs file names will get dublicated and will cause some frustration

The solution: for now just renaming the files from the digits form to meaningful names + modifying the metadata by adding the whole Mushaf to signle album and single artist so it's easy to distinguish
in music players on phones and computers
