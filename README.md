# Quran-sur-renamer

The problem to fix: mostly when I am downloading the full Mushaf I find the file names in digits (001.mp3, 002.mp3...etc) with unoraganised metadata and if there was 2 or more recites from different Sheikhs, file names will get duplicated and will cause some frustration.

The solution: for now just renaming the files from the digits form to meaningful names, and modifying the metadata by adding the whole Mushaf to a signle album and a single artist so it's easy to distinguish in music players on phones and computers.
